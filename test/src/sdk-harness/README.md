# Building & running the sway-lib-std tests

## Building test projects

First, ensure we have the current version of `forc` installed.

```sh
cd sway
cargo install --path ./forc
```

In the `sway/test/src/sdk-harness` directory is a bash build script. To run it:

```sh
cd sway/test/src/sdk-harness
./build.sh
```

This will build all contracts and scripts under the `sway/test/src/sdk-harness` directory.
After a sucessfull build of all the projects:

```sh
forc test
```
