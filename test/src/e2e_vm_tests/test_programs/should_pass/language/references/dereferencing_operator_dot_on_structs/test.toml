# TODO Enable this test once the compiler stack overflow is fixed.
#      The migrated code, left as is, causes compiler stack overflow.
#      The code in `main.sw` uses a weird combination of generic types
#      having trait constraints on `Eq` and implementing `PartialEq`s
#      on those types that have `PartialEq` trait constraints on same
#      generic arguments.
#      The test could very likely be fixed by types having `PartialEq`
#      constraints instead of `Eq` (which also semantically makes sense)
#      but it is worth first exploring and fixing the compiler stack overflow.
