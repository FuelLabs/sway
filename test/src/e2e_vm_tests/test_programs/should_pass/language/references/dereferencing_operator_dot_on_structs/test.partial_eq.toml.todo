# TODO: Enable this `partial_eq` test once the compiler stack overflow is fixed.
#       The migrated code, left as is, causes compiler stack overflow.
#       The code in `main.sw` uses a weird combination of generic types
#       having trait constraints on `Eq` and implementing `PartialEq`s
#       on those types that have `PartialEq` trait constraints on same
#       generic arguments.
#       The test could very likely be fixed by types having `PartialEq`
#       constraints instead of `Eq` (which also semantically makes sense)
#       but it is worth first exploring and fixing the compiler stack overflow.
