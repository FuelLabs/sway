# This test tries to replicate a setup that happens with Mira where
# we end up having two versions of sway-standards in the same package,
# which needs special checking in the trait coherence checks.

# This is currently only possible to setup with the `{ git = "url", tag = "foo" }`
# dependency versioning scheme, but trying to use that here causes additional
# problems, and trying to use the dependency patching feature also proved problematic
# due to forc collapsing the remote package entries patched to the same local path.

# TODO: This test should be updated to use a same-named differently versioned
# package once that feature is added to forc.
