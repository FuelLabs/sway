# Writing end-to-end VM tests

In order to minimize compilation time of individual tests, strive to reduce dependencies in tests.

To achieve that, follow these guidelines:

- Use `implicit-std = false` if dependency on `core` is not needed. This is often possible when testing `should_pass/language` features.
- If the dependency on `core` is not needed, instead of using the project type `script`, that will, because of the encoding, depend on `core`, try using `library` instead.
- Do not use `std` just to conveniently get an arbitrary type or trait. E.g., if a test requires an arbitrary type or trait, go with `struct Dummy {}` or `trait Trait {}` instead of importing `Option` or `Hash`.
- If `std` functionality is needed, import the minimal [reduced `std` library](reduced_std_libs/README.md) that provides the functionality.
- Import the full `std` only if the provided [reduced `std` libraries](reduced_std_libs/README.md) do not provide required types.

Additionally, try to meaningfully group tests with high cohesion, rather then splitting them into several tests. Having only one test project reduces compilation time. E.g., instead of having two tests `test_some_feature_for_option_a` and `test_some_feature_for_option_b`, try having just `test_some_feature` and the two cases tested in, e.g., modules in that one test. Makes sure, though, that such test groupings are meaningful. We don't want to end up having artificially combined tests.

# Running end-to-end VM tests

This document assumes you have `fuel-core` running on the default port.

## Running all tests

In a second terminal, `cd` into the `sway` repo and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin=test
```

After the test suite runs, you should see:

```console
Tests passed.
_n_ tests run (0 skipped)
```

By default, `cargo` uses the debug build mode which might result in slow
execution. To speed testing up, you might want to use the release build mode:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin=test
```

This may speed the tests up by an order of magnitude.

## Running specific tests

From the `sway` directory run:

```sh
cargo run --bin=test -- specific_tests_pattern
```

The `test` crate supports filtering out tests with a regex, i.e.
`specific_tests_pattern` above.

For instance, the following command

```sh
cargo run --bin=test -- abi_impl
```

would only run tests with the `abi_impl` substring in their names and might
produce output similar to the following:

```console
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.66s
     Running `target/debug/test abi_impl`

 Compiling should_fail/abi_impl_pub_fn
 Compiling should_fail/abi_impl_arity_mismatch

_________________________________
Tests passed.
Ran 4 out of 322 E2E tests (0 disabled).
No IR generation tests were run. Regex filter "abi_impl" filtered out all 48 tests.
```

Note that if you `cd` into the `sway/test` directory, you can just say `cargo run [pattern]`.

## Getting more information while running tests

To print out the warnings and errors run

```shell
SWAY_TEST_VERBOSE=true cargo run [pattern]
```

from the `sway/test` directory.

# Snapshot tests

When an "e2e" test has a file named `snapshot.toml` it will run as `cargo insta` snapshot tests.
These tests can be run as normal: `cargo r -p test`, and in two new ways:

```
> cargo t -p test
> cargo insta test
```

Snapshots can be reviewed using normal "cargo insta" workflow (see [insta.rs](https://insta.rs/)).

For the moment, there is no configuration for `snapshot.toml`, so they are just empty files.
