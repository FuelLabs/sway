# Scripts

A script is a deployed bytecode on the chain which executes to perform some task. It does not represent ownership of any resources and it cannot be called like a contract. A script can return a value of any type.

This example script calls a contract.

```sway
script;

use example_contract::MyContract;

struct InputStruct {
    field_1: bool,
    field_2: u64,
}

// All scripts require a main function.
fn main () {
    let x = abi(MyContract, 0x8900c5bec4ca97d4febf9ceb4754a60d782abbf3cd815836c1872116f203f861);
    let asset_id = 0x7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777_7777;
    let input = InputStruct {
        field_1: true,
        field_2: 3,
    };
    x.foo(5000, 0, asset_id, input);
}
```
