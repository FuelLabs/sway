# Installation

Note that if you want to run (e.g. for testing) Sway smart contracts, a Fuel full node is required. Otherwise, the Sway toolchain is sufficient to compile Sway smart contracts.

## Binaries

Binaries for the Sway toolchain and Fuel full node are available to download at <https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-nightly-binaries> for the following architectures:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`

## Building from Source

The Sway toolchain can be built from source by following instructions at <https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway>.

The `fuel-core` full node implementation can be built from source by following instructions at <https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core>.
