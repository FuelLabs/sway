# Installation

Note that if you want to run (e.g. for testing) Sway smart contracts, a Fuel Core full node is required. Otherwise, the Sway toolchain is sufficient to compile Sway smart contracts.

## Building from Source

The Sway toolchain can be built from source by following instructions at <https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway>.

The Full Core full node implementation can be built from source by following instructions at <https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core>.
