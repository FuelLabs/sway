# Inline Assembly in Sway

While many users will never have to touch assembly language while writing sway code, it is a powerful tool that enables many advanced use-cases (ie: optimizations, building libraries, etc).

## ASM Block

In Sway, the way we use assembly inline is to declare an asm block like this:

```sway
asm() {...}
```

Declaring an `asm` block is similar to declaring a function.
We can specify register names to operate on as arguments, we can perform operations within the block, and we can return a value.
Here's an example showing what this might look like:

```sway
pub fn add_1(num: u32) -> u32 {
  asm(r1: num, r2) {
      add r2 r1 one;
      r2: u32
  }
}
```

Note that in the above example:

- we initialized the register `r1` with the value of `num`.
- we declared a second register `r2` (you may choose any register names you want).
- we use the `add` opcode to add `one` to the value of `r1` and store it in `r2`.
- `one` is an example of a "reserved register", of which there are 16 in total. Further reading on this is linked below under "Semantics".
- we return `r2` & specify the return-type as being u32 (the return type is u64 by default).
