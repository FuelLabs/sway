DISCUSSION:
Enable tab completion for Bash, Fish, Zsh, or PowerShell
The script is output on `stdout`, allowing one to re-direct the
output to the file of their choosing. Where you place the file
will depend on which shell, and which operating system you are
using. Your particular configuration may also determine where
these scripts need to be placed.

Here are some common set ups for the three supported shells under
Unix and similar operating systems (such as GNU/Linux).

BASH:

Completion files are commonly stored in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` for
system-wide commands, but can be stored in
`~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions` for user-specific commands.
Run the command:

$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
$ forc completions --shell=bash >> ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/forc

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and
log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

BASH (macOS/Homebrew):

Homebrew stores bash completion files within the Homebrew directory.
With the `bash-completion` brew formula installed, run the command:

$ mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d
$ forc completions --shell=bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/forc.bash-
completion

FISH:

Fish completion files are commonly stored in
`$HOME/.config/fish/completions`. Run the command:

$ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
$ forc completions --shell=fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/forc.fish

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and
log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

ZSH:

ZSH completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in
your `$fpath` variable. To use these completions, you must either
add the generated script to one of those directories, or add your
own to this list.

Adding a custom directory is often the safest bet if you are
unsure of which directory to use. First create the directory; for
this example we'll create a hidden directory inside our `$HOME`
directory:

$ mkdir ~/.zfunc

Then add the following lines to your `.zshrc` just before
`compinit`:

fpath+=~/.zfunc

Now you can install the completions script using the following
command:

$ forc completions --shell=zsh > ~/.zfunc/_forc

You must then either log out and log back in, or simply run

$ exec zsh

for the new completions to take effect.

CUSTOM LOCATIONS:

Alternatively, you could save these files to the place of your
choosing, such as a custom directory inside your $HOME. Doing so
will require you to add the proper directives, such as `source`ing
inside your login script. Consult your shells documentation for
how to add such directives.

POWERSHELL:

The powershell completion scripts require PowerShell v5.0+ (which
comes with Windows 10, but can be downloaded separately for windows 7
or 8.1).

First, check if a profile has already been set

PS C:\> Test-Path $profile

If the above command returns `False` run the following

PS C:\> New-Item -path $profile -type file -force

Now open the file provided by `$profile` (if you used the
`New-Item` command it will be
`${env:USERPROFILE}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

Next, we either save the completions file into our profile, or
into a separate file and source it inside our profile. To save the
completions into our profile simply use

PS C:\> forc completions --shell=powershell >>
${env:USERPROFILE}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
