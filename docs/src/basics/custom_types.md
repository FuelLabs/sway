# Custom Types

## Structs

Structs in Sway are a named grouping of types. You may also be familiar with structs via another name: _product types_. Sway does not make any significantly unique usages of structs; they are similar to most other languages which have structs. If you're coming from an object-oriented background, a struct is like the data attributes of an object.

To declare a struct type, use _struct declaration syntax_:

```sway
struct Foo {
    bar: u64,
    baz: bool,
}
```

This is saying that we have some structure named `Foo`. `Foo` has two fields: `bar`, a `u64`; and `baz`, a `bool`. To instantiate the structure `Foo`, we can use _struct instantiation syntax_, which is very similar to the declaration syntax except with expressions in place of types.

```sway
let foo = Foo {
    bar: 42,
    baz: false,
};
```

To access a field of a struct, use _struct field access syntax_:

```sway
// Instantiate `foo`.
let foo = Foo {
    bar: 42,
    baz: true,
};

// Access field `baz` of `foo`.
assert(foo.baz);
```

### Struct Memory Layout

_This information is not vital if you are new to the language, or programming in general._

Structs have zero memory overhead. What that means is that in memory, each struct field is laid out sequentially. No metadata regarding the struct's name or other properties is preserved at runtime. In other words, structs are compile-time constructs. This is the same in Rust, but different in other languages with runtimes like Java.

## Enums

_Enumerations_, or _enums_, are also known as _sum types_. An enum is a type which could be one of a number of variants. To declare an enum, you enumerate all potential variants. Let's look at _enum declaration syntax_:

```sway
enum Color {
    Blue   : (),
    Green  : (),
    Red    : (),
    Silver : (),
    Grey   : (),
}
```

Here, we have defined five potential colors. Each individual enum variant is just the color name. As there is no extra data associated with each variant, we say that each variant is of type `()`, or unit. It is also possible to have an enum variant contain extra data. Take a look at this more substantial example, which combines struct declarations with enum variants:

```sway
use std::collections::Vec;
use inventory_system::InventoryItem;
use inventory_system::Insurer;

struct Claim {
    insurance_company: Insurer,
    item_number: u64,
    item_cost: u64,
}

struct Receipt {
    customer: CustomerId,
    items_purchased: Vec<InventoryItem>,
}

struct Refund {
    customer: CustomerId,
    items_returned: Vec<InventoryItem>,
}

enum InventoryEvent {
    CustomerPurchase : Receipt,
    ItemLoss         : Claim,
    CustomerReturn   : Refund,
}
```

```sway
enum Color {
    Blue   : (),
    Green  : (),
    Red    : (),
    Silver : (),
    Grey   : (),
}

fn main() {
    let color = Color::Blue;
}
```

Here, we have instantiated a variable named `color` with _enum instantiation syntax_. Note that enum instantiation does not require the `~` tilde syntax. If we wanted to instantiate an enum with some interior data, it looks like this:

```sway
struct Claim {
    insurance_company: Insurer,
    item_number: u64,
    item_cost: u64,
}

let event = InventoryEvent::ItemLoss(Claim {
    insurance_company: Insurer::default(),
    item_number: 42,
    item_cost: 1_000,
});
```

### Enum Memory Layout

_This information is not vital if you are new to the language, or programming in general._

Enums do have some memory overhead. In order to know which variant is being represented, Sway stores a one-word (8-byte) tag for the enum variant. The space reserved after the tag is equivalent to the size of the _largest_ enum variant. So, to calculate the size of an enum in memory, add 8 bytes to the size of the largest variant. For example, in the case of `Color` above, where the variants are all `()`, the size would be 8 bytes since the size of the largest variant is 0 bytes.

## Methods and Associated Functions

_Methods_ are functions which are associated with a specific type and either refer to that type or mutate it. _Associated functions_ are very similar, but they do not actually use any of the data in the type. Associated functions could be standalone functions, but they
are included in a specific type for organizational or semantic reasons.

In order to declare methods and associated functions for a struct or enum, use an _impl block_. Here, `impl` stands for implementation.

```sway
script;

struct Foo {
    bar: u64,
    baz: bool,
}

impl Foo {
    // this is a _method_, as it takes `self` as a parameter.
    fn is_baz_true(self) -> bool {
        self.baz
    }

    // this is an _associated function_, since it does not take `self` as a parameter.
    fn new_foo(number: u64, boolean: bool) -> Foo {
      Foo {
          bar: number,
          baz: boolean,
      }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let foo = ~Foo::new_foo(42, true);
    assert(foo.is_baz_true());
}
```

Note the syntax of the associated function call: `~Foo::new_foo(42, true);`. This bit of syntax is unique to Sway: when referring to a type directly, you preface the type with a tilde (`~`). To call an associated function, refer to the type and then the function name.
To call a method, simply use dot syntax: `foo.iz_baz_true()`.

## Syntax Examples

```sway
enum Color {
    Blue   : (),
    Green  : (),
    Red    : (),
    Silver : (),
    Grey   : (),
    // etc...
}

enum Make {
    Ford      : (),
    Toyota    : (),
    Mazda     : (),
    Chevrolet : (),
    BMW       : (),
    // etc...
}
struct Car {
    make: CarMake,
    color: Color,
}
```
