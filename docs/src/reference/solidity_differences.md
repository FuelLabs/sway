# Differences From Solidity

This page outlines some of the critical differences between Sway and Solidity, and between the FuelVM and the EVM.

## Underlying Virtual Machine

The underlying virtual machine targeted by Sway is the FuelVM, specified [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs). Solidity targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), specified [here](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

## Word Size

Words in the FuelVM are 64 bits (8 bytes), rather than the 256 bits (32 bytes) of the EVM. Therefore, primitive integers only go up to `u64`, and hashes (the `b256` type) are not in registers but rather in memory. A `b256` is therefore a pointer to a 32-byte memory region containing the hash value.

## Unsigned Integers Only

Only unsigned integers are provided as primitives: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, and `u64`. Signed integer arithmetic is not available in the FuelVM. Signed integers and signed integer arithmetic can be implemented in high-level libraries if needed.

## Global Revert

Panics in the FuelVM (called "reverts" in Solidity and the EVM) are global, i.e. they cannot be caught. A panic will completely and unconditionally revert the stateful effects of a transaction, minus gas used.

## Default Safe Math

Math in the FuelVM is by default safe (i.e. any overflow or exception is a panic). Safety checks are performed natively in the VM implementation, rather than at the bytecode level like [Solidity's default safe math](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics).

## No* Code Size Limit

There is no practical code size limit to Sway contracts. The physical limit is governed by the [`VM_MAX_RAM` VM parameter](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/main.md#parameters), which at the time of writing is 64 MiB.
