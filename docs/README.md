mdbook build

## Generating documentation for Forc commands/plugins

The `mdbook-forc-documenter` [preprocessor](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/preprocessors.html) now automatically handles documenting forc commands and plugins, but some actions have to be taken for the preprocessor to work. Please read the [mdbook-forc-documenter README](../scripts/mdbook-forc-documenter/README.md) before making changes to Forc commands or plugins.

**It is important to note that changing the chapter names `Commands` and `Plugins` will affect the behavior of the preprocessor**. When renaming the chapters, please make the same change [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/a19681c2165402d289bc6bae7a46a580ef3be5b5/scripts/mdbook-forc-documenter/src/lib.rs#L45,L56).
