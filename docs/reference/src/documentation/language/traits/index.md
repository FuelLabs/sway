# Traits

A trait describes an abstract interface that types can implement. This interface consists of an `interface
surface` of associated items, along with `methods`.

```sway
trait Trait {
    fn fn_sig(self, b: Self) -> bool;
} {
    fn method(self, b: Self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

Associated items come in two varieties:

- [Functions](#associated-functions)
- [Constants](#associated-constants)

All traits define an implicit type parameter `Self` that refers to "the type that is implementing this interface".
Traits may also contain additional type parameters. These type parameters, including `Self`, may be constrained by
other traits and so forth as usual.

Traits are implemented for specific types through separate implementations.

## Associated functions

Trait functions consist of just a function signature. This indicates that the implementation must define the function.

## Associated constants

Associated constants are constants associated with a type.

An *associated constant declaration* declares a signature for *associated constant definitions*.
It is written as `const`, then an identifier, then `:`, then a type, finished by a `;`.

The identifier is the name of the constant used in the path. The type is the type that the definition has to implement.

An *associated constant definition* defines a constant associated with a type.

### Examples

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/traits/associated-consts/src/lib.sw}}
```

Associated constants may omit the equals sign and expression to indicate implementations must define the constant value.
