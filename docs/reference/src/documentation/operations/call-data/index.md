# Call Data

The term `call-data` refers to the metadata that is available to the recipient of a call.

In the following sections we'll cover the following `call-data`:

- [`Message Sender`](msg-sender.md): who is making the call
- [`Asset Sent`](msg-asset.md): which asset has been sent into the contract
- [`Amount of Asset Sent`](msg-asset-amount.md): how much of an asset has been sent
