# sha256

To use the `sha256` function we must import it.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/operations/hashing/src/lib.sw:import_sha256}}
```

To hash multiple values we wrap them into a [`tuple`](../../language/built-ins/tuples.md) however other [`compound types`](../../language/built-ins/index.md#compound-types) may be used.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/operations/hashing/src/lib.sw:sha256}}
```
