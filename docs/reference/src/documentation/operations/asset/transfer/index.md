# Transfer

The [standard library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/sway-lib-std) contains a [`module`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/sway-lib-std/src/asset.sw) that can be used to transfer (send) an asset from one owner to another.

There is one function that can be used to transfer an asset to any entity:

- [`transfer()`](./address-or-contract.md)

Specific implementation details on transferring assets to addresses can be found [here](./address.md).

Specific implementation details on transferring assets to contracts can be found [here](./contract.md).
