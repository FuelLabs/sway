# Transfer

The [standard library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/sway-lib-std) contains a [`module`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/sway-lib-std/src/asset.sw) that can be used to transfer (send) an asset from one owner to another.

There are three functions that can be used to transfer an asset:

<!-- no toc -->
- [`transfer_to_address()`](./address.md)
- [`force_transfer_to_contract()`](./contract.md)
- [`transfer()`](./address-or-contract.md)
