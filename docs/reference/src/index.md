# The Sway Book

<!-- TODO: edit -->

<!-- The Sway Language Book is about demonstrating the syntax of the language in addition to common operations. -->

<!-- The beginning of the book is focusing on the basics of the language however subsequent sections are not necessarily in order therefore if there is a section that catches your attention then feel free to jump to that section. -->
