# Hashing and Cryptography

The Sway standard library provides easy access to a selection of cryptographic hash functions (`sha256` and EVM-compatible `keccak256`), and EVM-compatible `secp256k1`-based signature recovery operations.

## Hashing

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/hashing/src/main.sw}}
```

## Signature Recovery

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/signatures/src/main.sw}}
```

> **Note**: Recovery of EVM addresses is also supported via `std::vm::evm`.
