# The Sway Programming Language

Sway is a domain-specific language (DSL) for the [Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM)](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs), a blockchain-optimized VM designed for the Fuel blockchain. Sway is based on [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), and includes syntax to leverage a blockchain VM without needlessly verbose boilerplate.

This book documents how to write smart contracts in Sway, along with how to install and use the Sway toolchain.

Before starting developing smart contracts in Sway, please keep in mind the [known issues and workarounds](./reference/known_issues_and_workarounds.md) of the language and toolchain.
