# What is a Smart Contract?

<!-- This section should explain what is a smart contract -->
<!-- contract:example:start -->
A smart contract is no different than a script or predicate in that it is a piece of bytecode that is deployed to the blockchain via a [transaction](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-specs/master/protocol/tx_format). The main features of a smart contract that differentiate it from scripts or predicates are that it is _callable_ and _stateful_. Put another way, a smart contract is analogous to a deployed API with some database state.
<!-- contract:example:end -->

The interface of a smart contract, also just called a contract, must be defined strictly with an [ABI declaration](#the-abi-declaration). See [this contract](../examples/subcurrency.md) for an example.

## Syntax of a Smart Contract

As with any Sway program, the program starts with a declaration of what [program type](./index.md) it is. A contract must also either define or import an [ABI declaration](#the-abi-declaration) and implement it.

<!-- This section should explain best practices for ABIs -->
<!-- abi:example:start -->
It is considered good practice to define your ABI in a separate library and import it into your contract. This allows callers of your contract to simply import the ABI directly and use it in their scripts to call your contract.
<!-- abi:example:end -->

Let's take a look at an ABI declaration in a library:

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_abi/src/main.sw:abi_library}}
```

Let's focus on the ABI declaration and inspect it line-by-line.

### The ABI Declaration

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_abi/src/main.sw:abi}}
```

---

In the first line, `abi Wallet {`, we declare the name of this _Application Binary Interface_, or ABI. We are naming this ABI `Wallet`. To import this ABI into either a script for calling or a contract for implementing, you would use

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_smart_contract/src/main.sw:abi_import}}
```

---

In the second line,

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_abi/src/main.sw:receive_funds}}
```

we are declaring an ABI method called `receive_funds` which, when called, should receive funds into this wallet. Note that we are simply defining an interface here, so there is no _function body_ or implementation of the function. We only need to define the interface itself. In this way, ABI declarations are similar to [trait declarations](../advanced/traits.md). This particular ABI method does not take any parameters.

---

In the third line,

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_abi/src/main.sw:send_funds}}
```

we are declaring another ABI method, this time called `send_funds`. It takes two parameters: the amount to send, and the address to send the funds to.

>**Note**: The ABI methods `receive_funds` and `send_funds` also require the annotation `#[storage(read, write)]` because their implementations require reading and writing a storage variable that keeps track of the wallet balance, as we will see shortly. Refer to [Purity](
../blockchain-development/purity.md#Purity) for more information on storage annotations.

## Implementing an ABI for a Smart Contract

Now that we've discussed how to define the interface, let's discuss how to use it. We will start by implementing the above ABI for a specific contract.

Implementing an ABI for a contract is accomplished with `impl <ABI name> for Contract` syntax. The `for Contract` syntax can only be used to implement an ABI for a contract; implementing methods for a struct should use `impl Foo` syntax.

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_smart_contract/src/main.sw:abi_impl}}
```

You may notice once again the similarities between [traits](../advanced/traits.md) and ABIs. And, indeed, as a bonus, you can define methods in addition to the interface surface of an ABI, just like a trait. These pre-implemented ABI methods automatically become available as part of the contract interface that implements the corresponding ABI.

Note that the above implementation of the ABI follows the [Checks, Effects, Interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.11/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) pattern.

## Calling a Smart Contract from a Script

>**Note**: In most cases, calling a contract should be done from the [Rust SDK](../testing/testing-with-rust.md) or the [TypeScript SDK](../frontend/typescript_sdk.md) which provide a more ergonomic UI for interacting with a contract. However, there are situations where manually writing a script to call a contract is required.

Now that we have defined our interface and implemented it for our contract, we need to know how to actually _call_ our contract. Let's take a look at a contract call:

```sway
{{#include ../../../../examples/wallet_contract_caller_script/src/main.sw}}
```

The main new concept is the _abi cast_: `abi(AbiName, contract_address)`. This returns a `ContractCaller` type which can be used to call contracts. The methods of the ABI become the methods available on this contract caller: `send_funds` and `receive_funds`. We then directly call the contract ABI method as if it was just a regular method. You also have the option of specifying the following special parameters inside curly braces right before the main list of parameters:

1. `gas`: a `u64` that represents the gas being forwarded to the contract when it is called.
2. `coins`: a `u64` that represents how many coins are being forwarded with this call.
3. `asset_id`: a `b256` that represents the ID of the _asset type_ of the coins being forwarded.

Each special parameter is optional and assumes a default value when skipped:

1. The default value for `gas` is the context gas (i.e. the content of the special register `$cgas`). Refer to the [FuelVM specifications](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-specs/master/vm) for more information about context gas.
2. The default value for `coins` is 0.
3. The default value for `asset_id` is `ZERO_B256`.
