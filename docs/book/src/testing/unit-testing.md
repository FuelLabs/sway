# Unit Testing

Forc provides built-in support for building and executing tests for a package.

Tests are written as free functions with the `#[test]` attribute. For example:

```sway
#[test]
fn test_meaning_of_life() {
    assert(6 * 7 == 42);
}
```

Each test function is ran as if it were the entry point for a
[script](../sway-program-types/scripts.md). Tests "pass" if they return
successfully, and "fail" if they revert or vice versa while [testing failure](#testing-failure).

## Building and Running Tests

We can build and execute all tests within a package with the following:

```console
forc test
```

The output should look similar to this:

```console
  Compiled library "core".
  Compiled library "std".
  Compiled library "lib_single_test".
  Bytecode size is 92 bytes.
   Running 1 tests
      test test_meaning_of_life ... ok (170.652Âµs)
   Result: OK. 1 passed. 0 failed. Finished in 1.564996ms.
```

Visit the [`forc test`](../forc/commands/forc_test.md) command reference to find
the options available for `forc test`.

## Testing Failure

Forc supports testing failing cases for test functions declared with `#[test(should_revert)]`. For example:

```sway
#[test(should_revert)]
fn test_meaning_of_life() {
    assert(6 * 6 == 42);
}
```

Tests with `#[test(should_revert)]` considered to be passing if they are reverting.

## Calling Contracts

Unit tests can call contract functions an example for such calls can be seen below.

```sway
contract;

abi MyContract {
    fn test_function() -> bool;
}

impl MyContract for Contract {
    fn test_function() -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

To test the `test_function()`, a unit test like the following can be written.

```sway
#[test]
fn test_success() {
    let contract_id = 0xa8f18533afc18453323bdf17c83750c556916ab183daacf46d7a8d3c633a40ee;
    let caller = abi(MyContract, contract_id);
    let result = caller.test_function {}();
    assert(result == true)
}
```

It is also possible to test failure with contract calls as well.

```sway
#[test(should_revert)]
fn test_fail() {
    let contract_id = 0xa8f18533afc18453323bdf17c83750c556916ab183daacf46d7a8d3c633a40ee;
    let caller = abi(MyContract, contract_id);
    let result = caller.test_function {}();
    assert(result == false)
}
```

> **Note:** `contract_id` is needed for the `abi` cast used in the test. Running `forc test` will output deployed contract's id and that can be used for the cast. This means, before writing the `test_success()` test, `forc test` needs to be executed to retrieve the `contract_id`. This will not be necessary in the future and you can track the progress at [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/3673).
