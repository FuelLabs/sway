# Testing

Sway aims to provide facilities for both unit testing and integration testing.

**Unit testing** refers to "in-language" test functions annotated with `#[test]`.

**Integration testing** refers to the testing of your Sway project's integration
within some wider application. You can add integration testing to your Sway+Rust
projects today using the cargo generate template and Rust SDK.
