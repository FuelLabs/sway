# `forc-client`

Forc plugin for interacting with a Fuel node.

## Initializing the wallet and adding accounts

If you don't have an initialized wallet or any account for your wallet you won't be able to sign transactions.

To create a wallet you can use `forc wallet new`. It will ask you to choose a password to encrypt your wallet. After the initialization is done you will have your mnemonic phrase.

After you have created a wallet, you can derive a new account by running `forc wallet account new`. It will ask your password to decrypt the wallet before deriving an account.

## Signing transactions using `forc-wallet` CLI

To submit the transactions created by `forc deploy` or `forc run`, you need to sign them first (unless you are using a client without UTXO validation). To sign a transaction you can use `forc-wallet` CLI. This section is going to walk you through the whole signing process.

By default `fuel-core` runs without UTXO validation, this allows you to send invalid inputs to emulate different conditions.

If you want to run `fuel-core` with UTXO validation, you can pass `--utxo-validation` to `fuel-core run`.

To install `forc-wallet` please refer to `forc-wallet`'s [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc-wallet#forc-wallet).

1. Construct the transaction by using either `forc deploy` or `forc run`. To do so simply run `forc deploy` or `forc run` with your desired parameters. For a list of parameters please refer to the [forc-deploy](./forc_deploy.md) or [forc-run](./forc_run.md) section of the book. Once you run either command you will be asked the address of the wallet you are going to be signing with. After the address is given the transaction will be generated and you will be given a transaction ID. At this point CLI will actively wait for you to insert the signature.
2. Take the transaction ID generated in the first step and sign it with `forc wallet sign --account <account_index> tx-id <transaction_id>`. This will generate a signature.
3. Take the signature generated in the second step and provide it to `forc-deploy` (or `forc-run`). Once the signature is provided, the signed transaction will be submitted.

## Other useful commands of `forc-wallet`

- You can see a list of existing accounts with `accounts` command.

```sh
forc wallet accounts
```

- If you want to retrieve the address for an account by its index you can use `account` command.

```sh
forc wallet account <account_index>
```

> If you want to sign the transaction generated by `forc-deploy` or `forc-run` with an account funded by default once you start your local node, you can pass `--default-signer` to them. Please note that this will only work against your local node.
>
> ```sh
> forc-deploy --default-signer
> ```
>
> ```sh
> forc-run --default-signer
> ```

By default `--default-signer` flag would sign your transactions with the following private-key:

```sh
0xde97d8624a438121b86a1956544bd72ed68cd69f2c99555b08b1e8c51ffd511c
```

## Interacting with the testnet

To interact with the latest testnet, use the `--testnet` flag. When this flag is passed, transactions created by `forc-deploy` will be sent to the `beta-4` testnet.

```sh
forc-deploy --testnet
```

It is also possible to pass the exact node URL while using `forc-deploy` or `forc-run` which can be done using `--node-url` flag.

```sh
forc-deploy --node-url https://beta-3.fuel.network
```

Another alternative is the `--target` option, which provides useful aliases to all targets. For example if you want to deploy to `beta-3` you can use:

```sh
forc-deploy --target beta-3
```

Since deploying and running projects on the testnet cost gas, you will need coins to pay for them. You can get some using the [testnet faucet](https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network/).

## Deployment Artifacts

forc-deploy saves the details of each deployment in the `out/deployments` folder within the project's root directory. Below is an example of a deployment artifact:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "0xec27bb7a4c8a3b8af98070666cf4e6ea22ca4b9950a0862334a1830520012f5d",
