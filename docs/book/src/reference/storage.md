# Storage

A [smart contract](../../language/program-types/contract.md) is able to perform computation and store & manipulate data over time.

In the following sections we'll take a look at how Sway handles `storage` through:

- [Storage Initialization](init.md): How to declare a `storage` block
- [Reading & Writing](read-write.md): How to read from and write to storage
- [Libraries](libraries/index.md): Additional functionality provided by the [storage library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/sway-lib-std/src/storage.sw)
- [Namespaces](namespace.md): How to use `storage` namespaces
- [In keyword](in-keyword.md): How to override storage variable position
