# _swayfmt_

A tool for formatting Sway code according to style guidelines.

## Installation

To use `swayfmt` you'll need to install the [`forc-fmt`](../forc-plugins/forc-fmt/) plugin that will run the formatter. You can install the complete Fuel toolchain with [`fuelup`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup), or for `swayfmt` only, see [`CONTRIBUTING`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
