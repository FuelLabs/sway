# _swayfmt_

A tool for formatting Sway code according to style guidelines.

## Quickstart

- To use `swayfmt`, install the [forc-fmt](../forc-plugins/forc-fmt/) plugin using [fuelup](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup).
- To contribute to `swayfmt`, see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration with `swayfmt.toml`

Swayfmt _is_ meant to be configurable, however configuration is currently not supported due to lack of resources.
