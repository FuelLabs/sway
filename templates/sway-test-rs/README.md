# Rust + Sway integration testing

A cargo-generate template that makes it easy to initialise Rust integration
testing within an existing Sway project.

This template is designed for Rust developers who wish to test integration of
their Rust application and Sway code.

See the "Testing with Rust" chapter of [the Sway
Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.25.0/) for a thorough guide on how to
use this template.
