# StorageMap

Generic storage maps are available in the standard library as `StorageMap<K, V>` which have to be defined inside a `storage` block and allow you to call `insert()` and `get()` to insert values at specific keys and get those values respectively. Refer to [Storage Maps](../common-collections/storage_map.md) for more information about `StorageMap<K, V>`.
