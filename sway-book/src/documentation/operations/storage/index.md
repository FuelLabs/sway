# Storage

A [smart contract](../../language/program-types/contract.md) is able to perform computation and store & manipulate data over time. 

In the following sections we'll take a look at how Sway handles `storage` through:

- [Storage Initialization](init.md): How to declare a `storage` block
- [Mapping](storage-map.md): Tracking key-value pairs
- [Vectors](storage-vec.md): Using a persistent (not heap-allocated) vector
- [Get & Insert](get-insert.md): Manually manipulating storage slots
