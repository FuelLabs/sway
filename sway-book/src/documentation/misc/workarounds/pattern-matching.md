# Pattern Matching

In [complex pattern matching](../../language/control-flow/match/complex.md) for enums we use a nested `match` expression by embedding it inside the `{}` brackets on the right side of the arrow `=>`.

Match expressions cannot be used as a pattern, the left side of the arrow `=>`.
