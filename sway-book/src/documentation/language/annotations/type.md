# Types

A variable declaration can contain a _type annotation_. A type annotation serves the purpose of declaring the type, in addition to the value, of a variable. Let's take a look:

```sway
let foo: u32 = 5;
```

We have just declared the _type_ of the variable `foo` as a `u32`, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer. Let's take a look at a few other type annotations:

```sway
let bar: str[4] = "sway";
let baz: bool = true;
```

If the value declared cannot be assigned to the declared type, there will be an error generated by the compiler.


The following three variables show how a string can be instantiated. The length of each string is placed inside the `[]` to let the compiler know that the type is a string of length `[<length>]`.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/built-ins/strings/src/lib.sw:explicit}}
```

It can be seen that the variable `fuel` is a string of length four because "fuel" has four characters (f, e, u and l).

The example above is a demonstration which emphasizes the fixed-length aspect of strings however the compiler is smart enough to infer the size and thus the string type (and length) does not need to be specified.
