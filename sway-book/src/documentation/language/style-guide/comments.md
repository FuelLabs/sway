# Comments

In [regular comments](../comments/index.md#regular-comments) we outline two forms:

- `// comment`
- `/* comment */`

The first form is generally encouraged however there may be instances where a comment needs to be placed in the middle of some code in which case the second form is encouraged.

For example, in [function declaration](../functions/index.md#function-declaration) the second form is used to indicate additional parameters.
