# Returning

In [returning from functions](../functions/return.md) we outline two styles of returning:

- [Explicitly](../functions/return.md#explicit-return) which uses the `return` keyword
- [Implicitly](../functions/return.md#implicit-return) which does not use the `return` keyword

In general the preferred style is to follow the [implicit](../functions/return.md#implicit-return) return however both are perfectly acceptable.
