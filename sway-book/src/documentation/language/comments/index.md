# Comments

Comments in Sway start with two slashes and continue until the end of the line.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/comments/src/lib.sw:single_line}}
```

Comments that extend beyond a single line need to include `//` on each line.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/comments/src/lib.sw:multi_line}}
```

You can also place comments at the ends of lines containing code.

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/comments/src/lib.sw:end_of_line}}
```

You can also do block comments

```sway
{{#include ../../../code/language/comments/src/lib.sw:block}}
```
