# Multi Line Arm

In the [previous section](./single-line.md) the arms in our `match` expression all consist of a single line of code. We can extend the functionality to allow any number of lines by wrapping the right side of the arrow `=>` in brackets.

```sway
{{#include ../../../../code/language/control_flow/src/lib.sw:multi_line_match}}
```
