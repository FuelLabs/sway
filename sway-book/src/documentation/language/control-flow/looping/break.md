# break

`break` is a keyword available for use inside of a `while` loop and it allows us to exit out of the loop before the looping condition is met.

In this example the `while` loop will iterate forever because the condition is set to `true`. In order to exit the loop we use `break` once the `counter` is greater than the value of `num`.
