# Control Flow

A control flow in a program is the order in which instructions are executed.

For example, a function may take an input `u64` and if the value is greater than `5` then it calls one function otherwise it calls a different function.

Controlling the order of instructions can be done through the use of conditional expressions such as [if](if-expressions.md) and [match](match/index.md) and through [looping](looping/index.md).
