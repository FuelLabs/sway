# Control Flow

A control flow in a program is the order in which instructions are executed. 

For example, a function may take an input `u64` and if the value is greater than `5` then it calls one function otherwise it calls a different function.

Controlling the order of instructions can be done through the use of

- Conditional expressions
  - [if, expressions](if-expressions.md)
  - [match](match/index.md)
- [Looping](looping/index.md)
  - [while](looping/while.md)
