- ABI Super traits
- AbiEncode buffer dynamic sizing
- Better error message when the type used in the ABI is unknown/error
- Better error message when main has impurity attributes
- ContractCall intrinsic interaction effect was not setup correctly
- one test was disabled
- compile error: should_pass/language/name_resolution_after_monomorphization
- compile error: should_pass/language/shadowing/shadowed_glob_imports (shadowing is strange)
- compile error: should_pass/language/name_resolution_inside_intrinsics
- new warnings: should_pass/dca/contract/superabi_contract_calls
- new warning: should_pass/dca/contract/abi_fn_params
    I think the new warning is correct
- vanished warnings: should_pass/dca/unused_fields 
- disabled: should_pass/language/name_resolution_after_monomorphization 
- disabled: should_pass/language/shadowing/shadowed_glob_imports 
- disabled: should_pass/language/name_resolution_inside_intrinsics

- std lib call frames methods changed a little bit
- run external_proxy not working. I am assuming is the LDC bug. the String "double_value" has the correct length, but crazy data
- increase_buffer_if_needed does not work as method
