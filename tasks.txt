New features
- ABI Super traits
- AbiEncode buffer dynamic sizing

Bugs Fixed
- ContractCall intrinsic interaction effect was not setup correctly

Fixing warnings and error messages
- Better error message when the core-lib is not in Forc.toml when needed
- Better error message when the type used in the ABI is unknown/error
- Dont warn impurity attributes on the "__entry" fn
- Dont warn CEI on the "__entry" fn

Test Disabled
- should_pass/language/name_resolution_after_monomorphization
- should_pass/language/shadowing/shadowed_glob_imports
- should_pass/language/name_resolution_inside_intrinsics
- run sdk-harness/external_proxy not working. I am assuming is the LDC bug. the String "double_value" has the correct length, but some crazy data

Test generating more warnings than before
- should_pass/dca/contract/superabi_contract_calls
    Case here is that trait for ABI are generating two fn. One prefixed __contract_entry and another normal. One of them is not beign called.
- should_pass/dca/contract/abi_fn_params
    I think the new warning is correct

Test with less warnings than before
- should_pass/dca/unused_fields (auto-impl is making all fields being used. so no dead code warn is being generated)

Changes to std-lib
- some call frames methods changed a little bit
- predicate_data also changed

ICE
- increase_buffer_if_needed impl is a little bit strange because does not work as method. it gives a strange ICE
