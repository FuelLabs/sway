## EXAMPLE

You can use `forc deploy`, which triggers a contract deployment transaction and sends it to a running node.

Alternatively, you can deploy your Sway contract programmatically using [fuels-rs](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs), our Rust SDK.

You can find an example within our [fuels-rs book](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-rs/latest/getting-started/basics.html#deploying-a-sway-contract).
