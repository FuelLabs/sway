## EXAMPLE

```console
$ mkdir my-fuel-project
$ cd my-fuel-project
$ forc init
$ tree
.
├── Forc.toml
└── src
    └── main.sw
```

`Forc.toml` is the Forc manifest file, containing information about the project and dependencies.

A `src/` directory is created, with a single `main.sw` Sway file in it.
