## EXAMPLE

You can write tests in Rust using our [Rust SDK](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs). These tests can be run using `forc test`, which will look for Rust tests under the `tests/` directory (which is created automatically with `forc new`).

You can find an example under the [Testing with Rust](../../testing/testing-with-rust.md) section.
