## EXAMPLE

```console
$ forc new my-fuel-project
$ cd my-fuel-project
$ tree
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── Forc.toml
├── src
│   └── main.sw
└── tests
    └── harness.rs
```

`Forc.toml` is the Forc manifest file, containing information about the project and dependencies. `Cargo.toml` is the Rust project manifest file, used by the Rust-based tests package.

A `src/` directory is created, with a single `main.sw` Sway file in it.

A `tests/` directory is also created. The `Cargo.toml` in the root directory contains necessary Rust dependencies to enable you to write Rust-based tests using our Rust SDK (`fuels-rs`). More on this in the `Test` section down below.
