# Fuel Security Policy

Thank you for helping make the Fuel ecosystem safe for everyone. The Fuel team take security bugs very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Fuel-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Fuel team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Non-Security Issues

If the issue is not security-related, please report it publicly by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/new).
