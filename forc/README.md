# Forc

Forc stands for Fuel Orchestrator. Forc provides a variety of tools and commands for developers working with the Fuel ecosystem, such as scaffolding a new project, formatting, running scripts, deploying contracts, testing contracts, and more. If you're coming from a Rust background, `forc` is similar to `cargo`.

Find out everything you need to know about Forc under [its chapter in the Sway book][1].
