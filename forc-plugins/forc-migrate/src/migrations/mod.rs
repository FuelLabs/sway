//! This module contains common API for defining and implementing individual
//! [MigrationStep]s.
//!
//! Migration steps are defined in the submodules. Every submodule has the name
//! of the corresponding breaking change Sway feature and contains all the
//! migration steps needed to migrate to that feature.
//!
//! The special [demo] submodule contains demo migrations used for learning and testing
//! the migration tool.
