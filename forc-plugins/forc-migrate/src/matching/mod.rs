//! This module contains common API for matching elements
//! within a lexed or a typed tree.
//!
//! A typical migration will search for certain elements in the
//! lexed or typed tree and modify them within the lexed tree.
//!
//! In the long term we want to have advanced infrastructure for both
//! matching and modifying parts of the trees, as discussed in
//! https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6836.
//!
//! Currently, we will start (very) small, by providing reusable
//! module functions for matching parts of the trees.
//!
//! For concrete examples, see the match functions and trait impls
//! implemented in the sub-modules.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! The goal was pragmatic. To create a simple to develop and extend API that
//! will offer easy discoverability of provided functions and methods, all in
//! order to move cumbersome and error-prone matching code out of the migration
//! logic.
//!
//! Migrations will use module level match functions to either search directly
//! within a parent or recursively (deep) within a scope. Match functions can
//! accept predicates to filter the searched elements. The predicates deliberately
//! accept `&&TElement` or `&&mut TElement` so that can be easily passed to
//! [Iterator::filter] function.
//!
//! ## Matching elements in trees
//!
//! Functions matching on lexed tree require mutable references as
//! input and return mutable references as output. This is according
//! to the premise that the non-code-modifying analysis will be done
//! on typed trees, while the code-modifying will be done on the
//! mutable lexed tree, as well as the typed tree.
//!
//! Matching can be done either directly within a parent, or recursively
//! within a scope. E.g., we can match for `StorageField`s that are
//! directly under the `storage` declaration, or for all `StorageField`s
//! that are in the `storage` declaration, in any of the namespaces,
//! recursively.
//!
//! Searching for elements "in-between", e.g., `StorageField`s in a particular
//! sub-namespace, is currently not supported, and must be done manually
//! within a migration.
//!
//! Matching is done on lexical or typed elements like, e.g., `StorageField`,
//! or `TyStorageField`, without any more convenient abstraction provided for
//! matching. This is also a simple beginning. A better matching framework
//! would expose a stable higher level abstraction for matching and modifying.
//!
//! ## Locating equivalent elements across trees
//!
//! Often we will find an element in the lexed tree, e.g., a `StorageField` in
//! order to change it, but will need additional information from its typed tree
//! counterpart, `TyStorageField`, or vice versa. The [TyLocate] trait offers
//! the [TyLocate::locate] method for finding a typed equivalent of a lexed
//! element. The [LexedLocate] does the opposite.
//!
//! Locating an equivalent will in most of the cases be implemented via equality
//! of spans. Locating can also cause multiple traversals of the same part of
//! a tree. For migrations, this will not cause a performance problem.
