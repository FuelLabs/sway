#![allow(dead_code)]
//! This module contains common API for matching elements
//! within a lexed or a typed tree.
//!
//! A typical migration will search for certain elements in the
//! lexed or typed tree and modify them within the lexed tree.
//!
//! In the long term we want to have advanced infrastructure for both
//! matching and modifying parts of the trees, as discussed in
//! https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6836.
//!
//! Currently, we will start (very) small, by providing reusable
//! module functions for matching parts of the trees.
//!
//! For concrete examples, see the match functions and trait impls
//! implemented in the sub-modules.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! The goal was pragmatic. To create a simple to develop and extend API that
//! will offer easy discoverability of provided functions and methods, all in
//! order to move cumbersome and error-prone matching code out of the migration
//! logic.
//!
//! Note that, although similar to static analysis tools like, e.g. Rust's
//! [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/), `forc migrate` is significantly
//! different. Instead of providing hundreds of independent lints that
//! automatically check for localized issues, migrations provide only a handful
//! of migration steps, that are orchestrated within a single migration process,
//! some of them possibly being interactive.
//!
//! Each migration step, in general, wants to take a look at a larger scope at a time,
//! often a module. This makes a typical approach, of using fine-grain visitor functions
//! less applicable. Also, the goal is to empower non-compiler developers to write
//! migrations.
//!
//! All this led to the design in which a single migration step is in focus, and can:
//! - search for elements of interest using the match functions,
//! - build new and modify existing lexed elements using the [super::modifying],
//!
//! Migrations will use match functions to either search directly
//! within a parent or recursively (deep) within a scope. Match functions can
//! accept predicates to filter the searched elements. The predicates deliberately
//! accept `&&TElement` or `&&mut TElement` so that can be easily passed to
//! [Iterator::filter] function.
//!
//! ## Matching elements in trees
//!
//! Functions matching on lexed trees are coming in two variants, immutable and mutable.
//! They differ in the mutability of their arguments and returned types, but
//! otherwise implement the same matching logic.
//!
//! Matching can be done either directly within a parent, or recursively
//! within a scope. E.g., we can match for `StorageField`s that are
//! directly under the `storage` declaration, or for all `StorageField`s
//! that are in the `storage` declaration, in any of the namespaces,
//! recursively.
//!
//! Searching for elements "in-between", e.g., `StorageField`s in a particular
//! sub-namespace, is currently not supported, and must be done manually
//! within a migration.
//!
//! Matching is done on lexical or typed elements like, e.g., `StorageField`,
//! or `TyStorageField`, without any more convenient abstraction provided for
//! matching. This is also a simple beginning. A better matching framework
//! would expose a stable higher level abstraction for matching and modifying.
//!
//! ## Locating equivalent elements across trees
//!
//! Often we will find an element in the lexed tree, e.g., a `StorageField` in
//! order to change it, but will need additional information from its typed tree
//! counterpart, `TyStorageField`, or vice versa. The [TyLocate] trait offers
//! the [TyLocate::locate] method for finding a typed equivalent of a lexed
//! element. The [LexedLocate] and [LexedLocateMut] do the opposite.
//!
//! Locating an equivalent will in most of the cases be implemented via equality
//! of spans. Locating can also cause multiple traversals of the same part of
//! a tree. For migrations, this will not cause a performance problem.
