## Documentation

## Building from Source

This section is for developing the Sway compiler and toolchain. For developing contracts and using Sway, see the above documentation section.

### Dependencies

Sway is built in Rust. To begin, install the Rust toolchain following instructions at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>. Then configure your Rust toolchain to use Rust `stable`:

```sh
rustup default stable
```

If not already done, add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH` by adding the following line to `~/.profile` and restarting the shell session.

```sh
export PATH="${HOME}/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
```

### Building Forc

Clone the repository and build the Sway toolchain:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FuelLabs/sway.git
cd sway
cargo build
```

Confirm the Sway toolchain built successfully:

```sh
cargo run --bin forc -- --help
```
