# Contributing
We have some basic Git standards that we use here.
1. Branch names should be prefixed with your Github username and named after an issue number. For example, `sezna/149`.
1. Commit messages should be meaningful and understandable to the whole team, be in present tense, and be grammatical.
1. If a PR is not marked as a draft, every update to it emails all reviewers. For this reason, a non-draft PR should only be pushed to when it is ready to be reviewed again.
1. If needed, rebase/clean up commits to follow the above rules before opening a PR.
1. Releases are done via tags of the format `vX.X.X`.
