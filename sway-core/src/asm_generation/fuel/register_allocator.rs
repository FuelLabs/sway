// Initially, the bytecode will have a lot of individual registers being used. Each register will
// have a new unique identifier. For example, two separate invocations of `+` will result in 4
// registers being used for arguments and 2 for outputs.
//
// After that, the level 0 bytecode will go through a process where register use is minified,
// producing level 1 bytecode. This process is as such:
//
// 1. Detect the last time a register is read. After that, it can be reused and recycled to fit the
//    needs of the next "level 0 bytecode" register
//
// 2. Detect needless assignments and movements, and substitute registers in.
//    i.e.
//    a = b
//    c = a
//
//    would become
//    c = b
//
//
// After the level 1 bytecode is produced, level 2 bytecode is created by limiting the maximum
// number of registers and inserting bytecode to read from/write to memory where needed. Ideally,
// the algorithm for determining which registers will be written off to memory is based on how
// frequently that register is accessed in a particular section of code. Using this strategy, we
// hope to minimize memory writing.
//
// For each line, the number of times a virtual register is accessed between then and the end of the
// program is its register precedence. A virtual register's precedence is 0 if it is currently in
// "memory", and the above described number if it is not. This prevents over-prioritization of
// registers that have already been written off to memory.
//
/// The [SwayAsmSet] contains either a contract ABI and corresponding ASM, a script's main
/// function's ASM, or a predicate's main function's ASM. ASM is never generated for libraries,
/// as that happens when the library itself is imported.
