//! This module handles the process of iterating through the typed AST and ensuring that all types
//! are well-defined and well-formed. This process is run on the AST before we pass it into the IR,
//! as the IR assumes all types are well-formed and will throw an ICE (internal compiler error) if
//! that is not the case.
