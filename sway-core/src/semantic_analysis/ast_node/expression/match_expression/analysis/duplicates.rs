/// In case of alternatives, we must have the same variables in all of the alternatives,
/// and these are, of course, not duplicates.
/// But we can still have duplicates within the alternatives, and between the alternatives
/// and the other parts of the match arm.
///
/// Consider the following examples:
///
/// ```ignore
/// Struct { x, y: x, z: x } => x.0,
/// ```
/// The second and the third `x` are the duplicates of the first `x`.
///
/// ```ignore
/// Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. } => x,
/// (Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, Struct { y, .. } | Struct { y, .. }) => if x { 0 } else { 1 } + y,
/// ```
/// Here there are no duplicates.
///
/// ```ignore
/// (Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }) => if x { 0 } else { 1 } + y,
/// ```
/// The second `x` is not a duplicate, but the third and fourth are duplicates of the first one.
///
/// ```ignore
/// Struct { x, y: x, z: x } | Struct { x, y: x, z: x } => x,
/// ```
/// The second and the third `x` are duplicates of the first one, and the last two of the fourth one.
///
/// ```ignore
/// (x, Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, y) => y,
/// ```
/// The second and the third `x` are duplicates of the first one.
///
/// ```ignore
/// (0, Struct { x, y: x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, x) => x,
/// ```
/// The second and the last `x` are duplicates of the first one. The third one is not a duplicate.
///
/// ```ignore
/// (x, Struct { x, y: x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, x) => x,
/// ```
/// All `x`s are duplicates of the first one.
///
/// Why not extend `matcher` to do this analysis?
/// It would be a mixing of concerns and would complicate a clean implementation of the `matcher`.
/// The `matcher`'s purpose is to detect variables and their types and properly bind them.
/// Duplicates are seen as shadowing of variables which is perfectly fine from the `matcher`
/// perspective.
///
/// How the algorithm works?
///
/// For a match arm represented by the `scrutinee` it creates a tree whose nodes are variable names.
/// Variables are added by moving through the match arm left to right.
/// Branching in the tree occurs in the case of alternatives.
/// The algorithm traverses the branches depth-first and collects all the unique duplicates for every branch.
/// Unique means that a duplicate can occur only in one branch.
/// At the end it merges the result of all the branches in a single result.
///
/// The algorithm assumes that the `matcher` already checked the match arm.
/// This gives us the guarantee that every alternative contains the same variables and that for
/// the parts of the match arm that follows alternatives, we need to consider only the left-most
/// alternative as a potential holder of the already defined variables.
///
/// For the examples given above, the corresponding trees look like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// Struct { x, y: x, z: x } => x.0,
/// - x - x - x
///
/// Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. } => x,
///  / x
/// -
///  \ x <= this is the first, left-most x
///
/// (Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, Struct { y, .. } | Struct { y, .. }) => if x { 0 } else { 1 } + y,
///  / x
/// -     / y
///  \ x -
///       \ y <= this is the left-most y
///
/// (Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }) => if x { 0 } else { 1 } + y,
///  / x
/// -     / x
///  \ x -
///       \ x
///
/// Struct { x, y: x, z: x } | Struct { x, y: x, z: x } => x,
///  / x - x - x
/// -
///  \ x - x - x
///
/// (x, Struct { x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, y) => y,
///    / x
/// -x-
///    \ x - y
///
/// (0, Struct { x, y: x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, x) => x,
///  / x
/// -
///  \ x - x - x
///
/// (x, Struct { x, y: x, .. } | Struct { x, .. }, x) => x,
///    / x
/// -x-
///    \ x - x - x
///
/// ```
///
/// And here is a some general example with nested alternatives, several variables etc.
///
/// ```ignore
/// (x, y, x | x | x, Struct { x, y, z } | Struct { x: y | y | y, x, z }, z, x | x, z | z | z)
///
///         / x
///        /         / y
/// - x - y - x   / -  y
///        \     /   \ y - x - z
///         \ x -
///              \               / x
///               \ x - y - z - z     / z
