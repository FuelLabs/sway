# if let

Like Rust, `if`s are expressions in Sway. What this means is you can use `if` expressions on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable.

```sway
let my_data = if some_bool < 10 { foo() } else { bar() };
```

Note that all branches of the `if` expression must return a value of the same type.
