/// In FuelVM, the heap begins at `VM_MAX_RAM - 1` and grows downward.
/// Heap pointer `$hp` will always point to unallocated space.
///
/// Initially the heap will look like this:
/// ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |
///                                               $hp^  ^VM_MAX_RAM
///
/// After allocating with `let ptr = alloc(8)`:
/// ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |
///                       $hp^  ^ptr                    ^VM_MAX_RAM
///
/// After writing with `sw(ptr, u64::max())`:
/// ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF |
///                       $hp^  ^ptr                    ^VM_MAX_RAM
